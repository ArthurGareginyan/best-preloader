== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, select the desired settings and click the "Save Changes" button. Enjoy your fancy preloader. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WP Admin Panel`" -> "`Settings`" -Äî> "`Preloader`".

= Q. How can I upload my image? =
A. You can put the URL of image to the "Preloader image" field.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Panel of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Please visit the [Dedicated Plugin Page on GitHub](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/best-preloader) and report.
