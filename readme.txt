== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. First, go to page "`Settings`" —> "`Preloader`".
On the plugins page select the desired settings, then click "Save Changes". It's that simple!

= Q. How can I upload my image? =
A. You can put the url of image to the "Preloader image" field.

= Q. Does this plugin require modification to the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is added/configured entirely from the website's Admin section.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using a simple WordPress settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is that the plugin has a conflict with another plugin you're using. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.
